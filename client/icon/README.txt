The png bitmap icons in this directory are produced
automatically from the svg icon using the minecraft-icons.sh
shell script. You will need inkscape to run it.

The svg icon was hand-designed and hand-drawn by me. It
certainly does not infringe Mojang copyrights, and hopefully
does not infringe their trademarks.
