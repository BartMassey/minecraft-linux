The `install-minecraft-icon.sh` shell script in this
directory installs svg and png bitmap icons for a
Minecraft-style grass block.

The png bitmap icons will be produced automatically from the
svg icon as a side-effect of the shell script, unless they
are already in this directory. You will need inkscape to run
it.

The svg icon was hand-designed and hand-drawn by me. It
certainly does not infringe Mojang copyrights, and hopefully
does not infringe their trademarks.
